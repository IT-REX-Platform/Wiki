# IT-Rex Purpose Statement

The purpose of the IT-Rex platform is to provide features specifically designed for asynchronous, online learning.
The intention is to create an environment that motivates students to study the course materials and keeps this motivation alive throughout the entire term.
As many schools and universities already have complex and well-established systems in place to manage courses, the IT-Rex platform is not designed to replace these systems.
Instead, the IT-Rex platform focuses on core features that are not available (to the same extent) in the existing systems in the domain of online learning.

The IT-Rex platform is intended to create new values that can be added (and potentially integrated) to existing systems.

## The domain of online learning

We define the domain of online learning as follows: Online learning includes all activites related to studying at schools and universities that happen in a Web-based system.
Such activities might be: Exchanging information via a forum, providing materials as files, planning the course dates and times via a calendar or similar, uploading videos or lecture recordings, providing online quizzes or test, providing upload functions for student homeworks, live sessions, surveys, ...

With IT-Rex we focus on the asynchronous aspects of online learning.
