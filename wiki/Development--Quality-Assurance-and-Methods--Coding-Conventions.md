# Coding Conventions 

## What are Coding Conventions?
Code conventions are guidelines on the structural quality of software  for each aspect of a program written in a specific language. 
Typically, code conventions include the following areas: 

- File organization
- Indentation
- Commenting 
- Declarations
- Statements
- Whitespace
- Naming conventions
- Programming standards
- Programming principles
- Architectural best practices

## Why do we need Coding Conventions?
Coding conventions are necessary for readability, understandability, and to support teamwork. 
In addition, the later maintenance, which is probably not performed by the original developer team itself, is eased.

**Important:** Every developer of the team must conform to the code conventions to make this work.

## How are Coding Conventions defined? 

For our chosen Programming Languages/Frameworks for Frontend and Backend (Java/Spring Boot; Expo/React) there are a lot of 
already existing Coding Conventions. Commonly one of these is selected and only adaptations/extensions are recorded.
