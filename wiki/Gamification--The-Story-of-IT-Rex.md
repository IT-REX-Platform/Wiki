# The Story of IT Rex

This document describes the overall story we want to tell in the IT-Rex platform. The Story of IT-Rex is designed to provide a logically consistent frame for individual gamification ideas. 

## Abstract

For every course a student subscribes to on the platform, they get one IT-Rex with a specific colour (colour is defined by the lecturer per course). [Optionally: different species of dinosaurs]
The user starts with an egg, and the dinosaur hatches and grows continously in relation to the student progress in the course. 
Eventually, the student finishes the course and keeps the (fully grown) dinosaur -- the dinosaur is then immutable.

## Growing Process and Feeding

The course timeline defines the amount of "food" the IT-Rex requires -- this is the same amount of food that a student can gain per week (or other time frame). 
There is a specific amount of food per course (e.g. 1000 food items): the food is automatically [optionally: manually] spread over the course timeline/chapters/...

The food is handed over to the IT-Rex automatically [optionally: manually with animations] once a student gains the food (by progressing in the course). 
The IT-Rex has a specific number of "growing stages" (e.g. 10 stages): growing requires a certain amount of food. 

Food item: apple XOR banana, the lecturer chooses one item per course [optionally: more different possible food items] 

## Cosmetics and Rewards

Indepently from the student's progess, a student can earn coins. Every user starts with the same amount of coins. 

Coins can be earned in several ways (these are just some ideas):
* Getting 100% in the first try of a particular lecture quiz
* Winning a match in Rex-Duell
* Reaching the next level in Rex-Duell: depending on the amount of finished matches you reach the next level
* Playing a match in Rex-Duell competitive mode: Before playing you have to deposit a fix amount of coins and the winner takes it all.
* Daily bonus/streak for logging in IT-Rex platform.
* Performance in a particular quiz mode (quizzes need to be defined in more detail). 

[optionally: There might be some randomness involved in how many coins are earned]

The coins are collected in a wallet on user level. Coins can be used to buy cosmetics in a shop on user level. There are different types of cosmetics (e.g. hats, sunglasses, etc.). Bought cosmetics then appear in the cosmetics inventory of the user. From there the cosmetics can be applied to the IT-Rex of a specific course. The IT-Rex has different item slots for different types of cosmetics depending on the growing stage (gains more slots with increasing size). A single cosmetic item can only be applied to one item slot of one IT-Rex at a time. The user can remove the cosmetic item again, then it reappears in the cosmetics inventory.

Possible types of cosmetics:
* Hats
* (Sun-)glasses
* Coats
* Costumes
* Tattoos
* Boots
* Piercings
* Rings, Wristbands, Earrings, Necklaces
* Background / landscape (special: animated)
* Haircut and Beard

[optionally: There could be a set of cosmetics that can not be purchased but depends on the ranking and scoring system (tbd)]

Coin name suggestions: IT-coin / fossils

## User Achievement List / Representation

On course level, users should be able to compare their IT-Rexes regarding different criteria.

On user level there is a coin wallet and a cosmetic inventory. Additionally, values of the course-level IT-Rexes could be accumulated: 

* Simple: Papa-Rex has an overall coin and food counter that sums up all coins and food items ever collected by a user to reflect their overall app experience.
* [optionally: trophy or badge collection]
* [advanced: There is a park (jurassic park) where all course IT-Rexes live, including park cosmetics...]
