IT-REX is built to be used by
* lecturers -> see [Lecturer User Guide](How-to-use-IT-REX--Lecturer)
* students -> see [Student User Guide](How-to-use-IT-REX--Student)

These are the intuitive perspectives, however in some cases lecturers may behave like students (e.g., they join the course of their colleague to get an insight into their teaching) or students behave like lectures (e.g., they work as tutors and support their lecturer in managing a course). Therefore, while users are either students or lecturers on application level, they may all have the same three roles within a specific course:
* participant
* manager
* owner

As students typically act as participants, the participant-perspective is also covered in the user guide for students.
And as lecturers typically own and/or manage a course, this perspective is covered in the user guide for lecturers.

What tells lecturers apart from students is the following: they have the priviledge to create a course in IT-REX.
