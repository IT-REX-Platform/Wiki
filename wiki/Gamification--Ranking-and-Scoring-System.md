# Scoring

There will be no calculation of a separate "score" as one single numeric value for the following reasons:
* It is hard to calculate a comparable, well balanced score.
* It does not really provide any additional value

Instead, there will be Rankings for several metrics.

# Ranking

As defined in the story of IT-Rex, there are two systems that allow ranking:
* REGULAR course progress measured in food items and the IT-Rex growing stages
* ADDITIONAL VOLUNTARY effort and quiz performance: coins and cosmetics

Also, the different quiz modes allow rankings based on the performance of a user.

## Course-Level Ranking: IT-Rex

All study progress and quizzes happen on course level. Therefore, it makes sense to create a leaderboard for each course including the following sections:
* course progrees / IT-Rex level scoreboard
* scoreboard for every quiz mode based on a representative metric (E.g. TurboMode Scoreboard: avg time per question, percentage of correct questions, ... / RexDuell: win/tie/loss statistics, win percentage, ... /...) -> depends on the quiz modes that will be created

Optional extensions: 
* in each leaderboard, the current number one receives a badge visible on the IT-Rex avatar
* achievements for being at the top of a leaderboard for a specific amount of time (e.g. 2 weeks)

## User-Level Ranking: Papa Rex

On user level, there is already the user wallet that can be used. Additionally, the food items could be accumulated to create the following leaderboards:
* Coin ranking: Sum of all coins a user has ever earned (no matter if they were spent) -> indicated student's eagerness in doing additional work in the app
* Food ranking: Sum of all food items a user has ever earned -> indicates overall experience of a student with the IT-Rex platform
* [potentially: representative value for each quiz mode (like averages, top scores) -> depends on the quiz modes that will be created]
