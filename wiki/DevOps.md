This page will present the findings from our kickoff meeting on the 15th December.
There we discussed and agreed upon some basic decisions like IDE, Git-Workflow and Technology.
These are going to be presented in the following.

# DevOps Motivation




# IDE

In order to bring peace and harmony to our code base, developers will be enforced to use certain styling guidelines.
The easiest way for ensuring the same stylings and to prevent technical difficulties, we decided on using the same IDE for every developer.

For frontend development this is: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). <br>
For backend development this is: [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/). <br>

Furthermore, this will enable us to easily help other developers when facing problems through remote screen sharing or similar things.


# Git-Workflow



# CI-Environment

Is currently being evaluated. Most knowledge is available in Jenkins.

[Frontend Travis](https://travis-ci.com/github/IT-REX-Platform/Frontend)

[Problems with Travis](https://travis-ci.community/t/builds-hang-in-queued-state/10250) are not only that the current pricing model doesn't allow infinite usage, but that builds can idle 

~33 mins.
