# Static Code Analysis
"Static code analysis is a method of debugging by examining source code before a program is run. 
Itâ€™s done by analyzing a set of code against a set (or multiple sets) of coding rules."[1](https://www.perforce.com/blog/sca/what-static-analysis)

## Frontend: Expo/TypeScript 


## Backend: Java/Spring Boot 

### Code Conventions
To check if the written source code in the backend conforms to the [Google Java Style Guide](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/styleguides/google-java-style-20180523/javaguide.html) 
the development environment Intellij and the Plugin Checkstyle are used. 

"Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard. It automates the 
process of checking Java code to spare humans of this boring (but important) task. This makes it ideal for projects that 
want to enforce a coding standard." [2](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/index.html)

Intellij is a leading Java IDE with built-in code inspection and analysis. With the additional help of the Checkstyle Plugin,
Intellij takes care of the correct formatting, e.g. with regard to indentation (In relation to the Google Java Code Guidelines), 
and marks violations of the Google Java Code Guidelines. A list of what conventions Checkstyle checks can be found [here](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/google_style.html). 

#### Plugin installation and configuration Checkstyle

**Precondition:** Intellij is already installed and opened 
 
1. Navigate to: File &rarr; Settings &rarr; Plugins
2. Search for **CheckStyle-IDEA** and install the plugin
3. Navigate to: File &rarr; Settings &rarr; Tools &rarr; Checkstyle 
4. Select **Google Checks** as Configuration File
5. Adjust the scan scope if necessary 

Adding the code style schema to the editor:
5. Download the google_style.xml 
6. Navigate to:  File &rarr; Settings &rarr; Editor &rarr; Code Style
7. Import the google_style.xml scheme as follows: ![CodeStyleSchema](./Images/CodeStyleSchama.png)

 **&rarr; Restart Intellij**
 
 After the restart the CheckStyle Plugin automatically checks the Google Java Style Conventions in the Background and marks the violations in the editor.
