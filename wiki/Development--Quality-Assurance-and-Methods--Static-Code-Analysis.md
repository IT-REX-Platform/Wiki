# Static Code Analysis
"Static code analysis is a method of debugging by examining source code before a program is run. 
Itâ€™s done by analyzing a set of code against a set (or multiple sets) of coding rules."[1](https://www.perforce.com/blog/sca/what-static-analysis)

## Quality Metrics and Heuristics
Some metrics for good code that should be covered by a static analysis tool.  Can be changed / completed by the team.
- **Maintability:** (see Microsoft's Maintainability Index). Often done on method-level
- **Cyclomatic complexity:** indicates complexity of a program by quantitatively measureing the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. A complex control flow requires more tests to achieve good code coverage and will be less maintainable. Can be done module or program-wise Includes:
    - Depth of Nested IF/ELSE statements
    - multiple SWITCH/CASE statements
- **Lines of code:** measured on diffrent levels: project / class / method. A very high count might indicate that a type or method is trying to do too much work and should be split up. It might also indicate that the type or method might be hard to maintain.
- **Coupling:** Measure in two directions - How many components are using the measured component and on how many components it relies on. A high number indicates that any change to the current component risks breaking those others, if many components depend on the measured one and vice versa.
- **Churn:** amount of edits (number of commits) to a source code file. A high churn indicates specific areas of the system that undergo a lot of updates. Exept for exceptions, this is normally an indicator that there are quality problems within a file.
- **Clones**
- **Compliance with Coding Conventions**
