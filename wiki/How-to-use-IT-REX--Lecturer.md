## Make Students Join your Course
In the current version of the system, all courses can be joined by a unique identifier. If you want students to join your course, you have to send them this identifier. Consequently, users without this information cannot join your course. You can retrieve the course ID as follows: When you are in your course (in any screen, in the example the course overview screen), you find the ID in the URL of your browser window. Copy it and send it to students.
