# The Story of IT Rex

## Abstract

For every course a student subscribes to on the platform, they get one IT-Rex with a specific colour (colour is defined by the lecturer per course). [Optionally: different types of dinosaurs]
The user starts with an egg, and the dinosaur hatches and grows continously in relation to the student progress in the course. 
Eventually, the student finishes the course and keeps the (fully grown) dinosaur -- the dinosaur is then immutable.

## Growing Process and Feeding

The course timeline defines the amount of "food" the IT-Rex requires -- this is the same amount of food that a student can gain per week (or other time frame). 
There is a specific amount of food per course (e.g. 1000 food items): the food is automatically [optionally: manually] spread over the course timeline/chapters/...

The food is handed over to the IT-Rex automatically [optionally: manually with animations] once a student gains the food (by progressing in the course). 
The IT-Rex has a specific number of "growing stages" (e.g. 10 stages): growing requires a certain amount of food. 

Food item: apple XOR banana, the lecturer chooses one item per course [optionally: more different possible food items] 

## Cosmetics and Rewards

Indepently from the student's progess, a student can earn coins.
