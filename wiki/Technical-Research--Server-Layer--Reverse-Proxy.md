# Reverse Proxy

## Reverse proxies:
* Nginx ("engine-ex")
* HAProxy

## Purpose:
A reverse proxy is a server between clients and backend server/s. It accepts requests from browsers and mobile apps and retrieves resources from servers for clients. So when a client sends a request to a server, he adresses the reverse proxy, which acts as a "public face" for backend.
