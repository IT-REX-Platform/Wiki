# Testing
"Software testers succeed where others fail." â€“ Anonymous

## Testing strategy
### How do we test?
- Classical
- Test driven
- Test first

**Suggestion:** Since we do not have an explicit requirements base I would recommend using a **test first** approach. Therefore our test specification is basically an implicit documentation of our requirements.

### Test levels
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- System testing
- Acceptance testing

### Test methods
- Smoke tests
- Performance tests
- Fuzzy tests
- Equivalence class testing
- Requirements based
- Regression tests
- Black-/White/Grey-Box testing

### Issue tracking?
Feedback loop in Jira? Bugtracker
### Metrics?
Code coverage?
Visualization? Tracking? -> Grafana?

What do we want to achieve?
- code coverage 100%
- pass rate?
- "optional" tests?

### Test automatisation?
What do we test when, how and where?
local, Jenkins stages...
## Test tools:
### Frontend
Expo recommends **Jest** as "most widely used JavaScript unit testing framework"
<br>
[Expo with Jest](https://docs.expo.io/guides/testing-with-jest/)

### Backend
JHipster does a lot of stuff:
[JHipster tests](https://www.jhipster.tech/running-tests/)
- **Unit tests** using **JUnit 5**
- **Integration tests** using the **Spring Test Context framework**
- **UI tests** with **Jest**
- **Architecture tests** with **ArchUnit**

Optionally, JHipster can also generates:
- **Performance tests** with **Gatling**.
- **Behaviour-driven tests** with **Cucumber**.
- **Angular/React/Vue integration tests** with **Protractor**.
