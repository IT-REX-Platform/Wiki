## Roadmap

The IT-Rex project is finally entering the implementation phase. The roadmap below visualizes the current state with respect to the overall project scope and duration: We're starting to implement the first basic functionality! :-)

![Roadmap](../graphix/roadmap01.png)

## Sprint Goal Overview:
* **Last sprint** (finished Dec 08, 2020): Finish the prototyping phase, define the application architecture and all relevent things to start the actual development. 
* **Current sprint** (started Dec 09, 2020): Bring IT-Rex to life with first basic functionality!

## Latest Achievements

* Definition of an **Architecture Baseline**: An overall baseline for the application architecture was defined to define a first skeleton for the platform implementation. See details about the [Implementation View](https://github.com/IT-REX-Platform/Wiki/wiki/Application-Architecture--Implementation-View). 
* Application **Technology Stack**: The decision for the major client layer technology has already been made based on extensive testing and research. IT-Rex will be presented to the treasured user both in the Web and on mobile platforms using Expo. See details in [Cross Platform Framework Documentation](https://github.com/IT-REX-Platform/Wiki/wiki/Technical-Research--Cross-Platform-Framework). Decisions for technologies to be used on server layer and data layer are about to be made, but research is still ongoing.
* Design of a preliminary **Data Model**: The [Data Model](https://github.com/IT-REX-Platform/Wiki/wiki/Application-Architecture--Data-Model) was developed to provide a first, high-level design of solutions spaces tackling the domain of online learning. A major focus was designing a model for courses to be structered both logically and timely.
* Integration of **Learning Management Systems (LMS)**: A detailed assessment of the provided APIs of [ILIAS](https://github.com/IT-REX-Platform/Wiki/wiki/Technical-Research--ILIAS-API) and [Moodle](https://github.com/IT-REX-Platform/Wiki/wiki/Technical-Research--Moodle-API) was conducted to verify where and integration to existing LMS could be beneficial. Most notably, the feasibility of reusing course details as well as course membership data originating from these systems was approved.


## Next Steps

* Commplete the technology stack (server layer and data layer)
* Define Quality Assurance Strategy and Methods
* Set up development and operation infrastructure
* Evaluate solutions for User Access Management
* Implement first functionality: Course creation
