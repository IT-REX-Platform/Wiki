# Adobe XD UI Export
There are some ways to export the UI Prototypes from Adobe XD. All of them have both advantages and disadvantages.
The only possible solution for exporting them is using PlugIns in XD which are not provided by Adobe but from a variety of other developers.
All plugins have nearly the same disadvantages. They are generated in a strict and almost the same manner and therefore they are neither responsive nor individual.
From an objective perspective it's just a preview of what you created in Adobe XD - but in your Browser than in XD. To make all views, components, etc. responsive and available for all devices it's still a long way to go. Furthermore, there is still the question of how fine the automated generated components can be filled with functionality and connected to the Backend.
